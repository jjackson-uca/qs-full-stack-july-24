    <h1> The History of Baseball</h1>
<h3> <b style="color: crimson;"> <i>From Early Beginnings to America's Pastime</b></i> </h3>
    <p> Baseball, often referred to as America's pastime, has a rich history that dates back to the early 19th century. The origins of the game are somewhat ambiguous, with various bat-and-ball games like rounders and cricket influencing its development. However, it was in the United States where baseball evolved into its modern form.</p>

<h2> Early Beginnings</h2>
<p> The first known reference to baseball in the United States dates to a 1791 ordinance in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, which banned the playing of the game near the town’s meeting house. By the mid-19th century, the game had gained popularity in various regions, particularly in New York. In 1845, Alexander Cartwright, a member of the Knickerbocker Base Ball Club, codified the first set of written rules, many of which still form the basis of the game today.
