                <p>I am sitting here writing a filler paragraph for my webpage as I am unsure as to what the contents of this webpage should be just yet.
                    I am having a pretty hard time trying to come up with what I want the webpage to look like in my head and I feel that the color pallete 
                    I have chosen could have been better. This website UI is very simple and I hope that as I learn more I will be able to create a more attarctive
                    and appealing website. I am very excited to learn more about web development and I look forward to the next 12 weeks of class.
                    All my fellow classmates seem very cool and I wish them all the best of luck with the class and with their futures. 
                    I dont know what else to say so I am going to spew nonsense and practice my typing skills.
                    I recently moved to florida and just started a job as a barista at starbucks. 
                    The job has not been to bad but there is ALOT to learn and the first week was very tough.
                    I think as I get more comfortable with the job, I will not have as hard of a time.
                    Now that I think of it, im gonna put a starbucks drink cheat sheet in the right hand side of this page.
